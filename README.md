# name-mismatch-finder

This is a project that is a companion project to another scraper I've written.  It helps find errors that would make joining the scraped data more difficult, in order to avoid those problems in the future.

TODO: Implement logging instead of writing out to the console.
Another consideration would be to incorporate this code into the original scraper to make this program redundant and perform the error-checking steps automatically.
